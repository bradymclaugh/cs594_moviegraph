<h3>The Jgraph Chess Example -- Even Ezell -- 2019</h3>

The chess example that Even Ezell did (<a href=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs494/494/notes/Jgraph/jgraph_chess/chess.html>http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs494/494/notes/Jgraph/jgraph_chess/chess.html</a>) is my inspiration for this lab.  I'm hoping that lots
of students come up with fun projects.

<h3>Displaying Running Back Stats -- Jonathan Ting -- 2020</h3>

Jonathan Ting wrote a program to grab NFL rushing stats from
their web site, and display how a running back performed during a game.  <a href=Ting/index.html>Here's his writeup</a>,
and a teaser graph:

<h3>Don't Run Into That Asteroid -- Thomas Hills -- 2020</h3>

Thomas wrote a program using jgraph to animate an asteroids-like game.
<a href=Hills/index.html>Here's his writeup (which contains a video example)</a>,
and a graphic:

<h3>Superball Meets Jgraph -- Kemal Fidan -- 2020</h3>

Kemal wrote a program that visualizes the effectiveness of potential moves in the
Superball game, which is a lab from COSC302 when I teach it.  

<a href=Fidan/index.html>Here's his writeup</a>,
and a graphic (you can click on the graphic to see it in its full size).

<h3>Knitting Charts with Jgraph -- Samantha Zimmerman -- 2020</h3>

Samantha wrote a program that turns PPM image files into knitting charts.
The github repo for her program is <a href=https://github.com/szimmer9/chartmaker>https://github.com/szimmer9/chartmaker</a>, and the README in html is in 
<a href=Zimmerman/index.html>Zimmerman/index.html</a>.

Here are two graphics that I created with her program -- there is a lot more functionality
that I didn't explore -- importantly, the dog on the right was my basset, Harvey!

<h3>Making Sheet Music -- Daniel Mishler -- 2022</h3>

Daniel defined a format for sheet music, and then wrote a program that generates the
jgraph to view the sheet music.  Here's the 
<a href=Mishler/README.pdf>README</a> that defines the format, and
his repo is <a href=https://github.com/DSMishler/jgraph_music>https://github.com/DSMishler/jgraph_music</a>.
Below is a list of example
sheet music files:

<LI> <a href=Mishler/mjms/amazing_grace.mjm>amazing_grace.mjm</a>

<LI> <a href=Mishler/mjms/moonlight_sonata.mjm>moonlight_sonata.mjm</a>
</UL>

And their corresponding output files:

<h3>Meta-balls -- Dominic Kennedy-- 2022</h3>

From Domonic: "This program uses ffmpeg, convert, and jgraph to produce a random
animation of meta-balls moving along a 2D plane.  The program uses
the bezier curve functionality in jgraph to render the meta-balls,
and ffmpeg to combine individual frames, to generate a fully animated
mp4 video."
<p>
If you're like me, you've never heard of a metaball, so I'll link you to
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs>Wikipedia's page on metaballs</a>.
Here's the quote from that page: "In computer graphics, metaballs are organic-looking n-dimensional isosurfaces, characterised by their ability to meld together when in close proximity to create single, contiguous objects."
<p>
To the right is a picture generated by Dominic's program, and in
<a href=Kennedy/example.mp4>this link has a video</a>.  Very cool!

His repo is
